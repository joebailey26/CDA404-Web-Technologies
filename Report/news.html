			<p>
				By far the most widespread tale espoused by 9/11 conspiracy theorists - often referred to as “truthers” - is that the United States government either helped the attackers succeed, or orchestrated the entire thing themselves.
			</p>
			<p id="nine-eleven">
				“Experts say part of the reason for the persistence of such conspiracy theories is the dissonance that results when people hear that a relatively small group of men using low-tech weapons caused such cataclysmic carnage,” says the BBC.

			<p>
				Project MKUltra was the code name for a series of investigations into mind-bending substances, techniques, and medical procedures. The goal was to develop truth serums, mind-control drugs, and determine what chemicals and methods had potential use for torture, disorientation, and espionage. 
			</p>
			<p id="mkultra">
				The experiments started in 1953 and were slowly reduced in scope over the next 20 years before being halted in 1973. A variety of experiments were undertaken to understand the effects of powerful drugs on unsuspecting subjects.

			<p>
					You've probably heard this conspiracy theory before, maybe from your uncle who still has his doubts about the Apollo 11 moon landing, or on a Reddit thread exposing the evils of "Big Pharma."
			</p>
			<p id="cancer">
					It goes like this: A cure for cancer exists, but pharmaceutical companies — and perhaps even government health agencies and cancer charities — are suppressing it because they make so much money from treating the disease or fundraising for it.
