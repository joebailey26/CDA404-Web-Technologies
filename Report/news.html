			<a href="/article-one.html"><title>It was an inside job - 9/11</title></a>
			<p>
				By far the most widespread tale espoused by 9/11 conspiracy theorists - often referred to as “truthers” - is that the United States government either helped the attackers succeed, or orchestrated the entire thing themselves.
			</p>
			<p class="read-more" id="article-one">
				“Experts say part of the reason for the persistence of such conspiracy theories is the dissonance that results when people hear that a relatively small group of men using low-tech weapons caused such cataclysmic carnage,” says the BBC.

			<p>
				Project MKUltra was the code name for a series of investigations into mind-bending substances, techniques, and medical procedures. The goal was to develop truth serums, mind-control drugs, and determine what chemicals and methods had potential use for torture, disorientation, and espionage. 
			</p>
			<p class="read-more" id="article-two">
				The experiments started in 1953 and were slowly reduced in scope over the next 20 years before being halted in 1973. A variety of experiments were undertaken to understand the effects of powerful drugs on unsuspecting subjects.

			<p>
				Seventeen years ago today four planes were hijacked by Islamic extremists in the United States. What happened to the passengers of United Airlines flight 93 on 9/11? One aircraft was deliberately crashed into the Pentagon near Washington DC, while two were flown into the World Trade Center in New York City.
			</p>
			<p class="read-more" id="article-three">
				A fourth plane came down in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to wrestle back control from the terrorists. The crashes, combined with the subsequent collapse of the two main towers of the World Trade Center, killed 2,996 people, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in recorded history.
