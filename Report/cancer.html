        <p>You've probably heard this conspiracy theory before, maybe from your uncle who still has his doubts about the Apollo 11 moon landing, or on a Reddit thread exposing the evils of &quot;Big Pharma.&quot; It goes like this: A cure for cancer exists, but pharmaceutical companies &mdash; and perhaps even government health agencies and cancer charities &mdash; are suppressing it because they make so much money from treating the disease or fundraising for it.</p>

        <p>In other words, a secret cabal of pharma execs, scientific researchers and cancer nonprofits are letting more than 8 million people die each year worldwide so they can line their pockets with cancer money. Such a plot, if true, would be nothing short of medical genocide.</p>

        <p>Ted Gansler is strategic director for pathology research with the American Cancer Society (ACS) where he serves as editor of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. Gansler heard the &quot;hidden cure&quot; story so many times that he actually went out and conducted a survey in 2002 about the most common misconceptions about cancer. In it, he asked nearly 1,000 Americans if they believed there was a conspiracy to hide a cancer cure.</p>

        <p>&quot;The result was even more shocking than I expected,&quot; Gansler writes in an email, reporting that 27.3 percent believed the myth and another 14.3 percent were uncertain. &quot;The 'secret cancer cure' is a typical conspiracy theory. Although its popularity is caused partly by ignorance, misunderstanding, and mistrust of science, psychological research indicates that inventing and spreading conspiracy theories is a way for some people to cope with feelings of vulnerability.&quot;</p>

        <p>Cancer is scary, and few of our lives have been untouched by its devastating reach. But just because the medical establishment hasn't yet found a blockbuster cure for all cancer doesn't mean that they're hiding it from us.</p>
