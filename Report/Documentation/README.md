# Web Technologies Assessment

## Introduction

## Background

A lot of people, particularly teenagers are interested in Conspiracy Theories. However, the only source of information they can find is either YouTube or Wikipedia.
YouTube delivers it's content in the forms of a video which is unsuitable to those who are deaf, or even people that just like to consume their content by reading.
However, Wikipedia then goes into too much depth. There is too large a chunk of information to read.

Conspiracy? News aims to fill the gap in the market by providing concise, accurate information that users can read in a lunch break. The platform will also offer users the ability to converse through the form of comments on individual posts. This way it is a deemed as a personal experience for users who will then be more likely to return to the site.

## Methodology

## Wire Frames

![Desktop Wireframe][/desktop-wireframe.jpg]

As the website is primarly aimed at teenagers the website will take a mobile first approach. Most teenagers consume content on their phone, therefore the website needs to work well and look good on the phone. The website will use elements of Material Design to mimic the look of a native application (something that may come later in the Software Development Lifecycle).

The Homepage will be a landing page to introduce new users to the site. There will then be a News page and Contact Page. Each individual News Article will have it's own page.
