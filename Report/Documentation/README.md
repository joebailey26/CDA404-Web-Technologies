# Web Technologies Assessment

## Introduction

## How to Run

`node app.js`

## Background

A lot of people, particularly teenagers are interested in Conspiracy Theories. However, the only source of information they can find is either YouTube or Wikipedia.
YouTube delivers it's content in the forms of a video which is unsuitable to those who are deaf, or even people that just like to consume their content by reading.
However, Wikipedia then goes into too much depth. There is too large a chunk of information to read.

Conspiracy? News aims to fill the gap in the market by providing concise, accurate information that users can read in a lunch break. The platform will also offer users the ability to converse through the form of comments on individual posts. This way it is a deemed as a personal experience for users who will then be more likely to return to the site.

## Client Requirements

1. A website to solve a problem
2. Publicize a problem
3. At least 4 pages
4. Responsive
5. Use GIT
6. Can't use visual editors or HTML Frameworks

## Aims & Objectives

1. Learn Sass
2. Practise Figma
3. Learn Node.js
4. Learn Firebase
5. Learn VuePress
6. Learn how to use Web Components
7. Learn Visual Studio Code

## Methodology

1. The first step of any project is to outline the aims and requirements which have been done in this documentation.
2. Wire Frames are then created to get a visual idea for the website. I used [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc) for this.
3. After Wire Frames have been created Medium and High Fidelity mockups are created using a program such as Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma. I used Figma. because this is a small project I only created Medium Fidelity Mockups.
4. Feedback is then received on any mockups which are then redrawn taking into account the feedback. I asked my friends and family what they thought and they didn't think anything needed changing about my mockups.
5. Development of the site then begins.
6. Once development has been completed a series of tests are performed on the application to ensure that it works as required. Some of these tests can now be automated using tools such as Gulp and Grunt however they were outside the scope of this project. I used Lighthouse which is built in to Chrome.
7. The application is then made live.

## Wire Frames

![Desktop Wireframe](/desktop-wireframe.jpg)

As the website is primarly aimed at teenagers the website will take a mobile first approach. Most teenagers consume content on their phone, therefore the website needs to work well and look good on the phone. The website will use elements of Material Design to mimic the look of a native application (something that may come later in the Software Development Lifecycle).

The Homepage will be a landing page to introduce new users to the site. There will then be a News page and Contact Page. Each individual News Article will have it's own page.

## Accessibility

## GDPR

The only data obtained via the website is through the contact form. As part of the contact form users have to explicitly agree to their data being possessed in order for their enquiry to be responded to.

## Distance Selling

This site does not sell any products or services. It merely distributes information for users to read. Therefore, it does not need to confrom to the [Online Distance and Selling Act](https://www.gov.uk/online-and-distance-selling-for-businesses) set out by the UK Government.

## Lighthouse Tests

## Evaluation

Overall I have experimented with the technologies I wanted to and have met the clients requirements. I have created an 8 page website using HTML, Sass, JavaScript and Node.js. This project has been a learning experience as outlined below.

### What I've learnt

1. Node.js is not suited for simple websites as it creates an awful lot of work for something which can be completed quite eaasily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Node.js is not suited to running on Firebase. They are for seperate things and extremely difficult to intertwine. This problem is made worse by the relative newness of both technologies meaning that information is not readily available on them.
3. Angular, Vue, and React are infact not JavaScript. They are tools for creating web applications, emphasis on the word application. This is heavily moving away from traditional web development and platforms I think in a negative way. It's making the internet about mobile and applications and not about providing information to the largest possible audience. Applications have their place, on mobile, or programs on a PC, or games on a games console, but that doesn't mean that they need to be on the web. The web is a different thing entirely and should be kept traditional in providing information.
4. I have learnt how to deploy my website to firebase using the CLI interface.
5. I've learnt how to use GIT on the command line and how to push my repository to GitHub.
6. I've learnt Sass which is a great tool for speeding up CSS development.
7. I've practised my design skills using Figma, adding to my current skillset of managing projects from design to implementation to testing.
8. I learned how to use VuePress to host my documentation on Firebase. VuePress can run on Firebase as it creates static files, however it isn't ideal running in a subdirectory as the URL is fairly ugly.
9. If you want to use split your html up into components, like a reusable header and footer, PHP is a lot easier, as the infrastructure is already there. The internet is a very old place, which makes it robust. New technologies are therefore hard to use, and unsupported on a lot of systems. An example would be IPv6. Furthermore, setting up an email to be sent on a form response is easy using PHP. Node.js requires a lot more groundwork for such a simple task.
10. Before this project I had been using Adobe Dreamweaver almost exclusively for coding. I'd been using it in the developer mode, so without the visual interface. It was great because I could push my websites live and to my testing server, and could use GIT. Using Visual Studio Code I've come to understand that it can recognize a lot more different types of code than Dreamweaver can, however the interface feels clunky, unrefined, and many of it's features are only enabled by extensions and not out-of-the-box.
