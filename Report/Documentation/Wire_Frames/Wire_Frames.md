As the website is primarly aimed at teenagers the website will take a mobile first approach. Most teenagers consume content on their phone, therefore the website needs to work well and look good on the phone. The website will use elements of Material Design to mimic the look of a native application (something that may come later in the Software Development Lifecycle).

The Homepage will be a landing page to introduce new users to the site. There will then be a News page and Contact Page. Each individual News Article will have it's own page.
