## Background

A lot of people, particularly teenagers are interested in Conspiracy Theories. However, the only source of information they can find is either YouTube or Wikipedia.
YouTube delivers it's content in the forms of a video which is unsuitable to those who are deaf, or even people that just like to consume their content by reading.
However, Wikipedia then goes into too much depth. There is too large a chunk of information to read.

Conspiracy? News aims to fill the gap in the market by providing concise, accurate information that users can read in a lunch break. The platform will also offer users the ability to converse through the form of comments on individual posts. This way it is a deemed as a personal experience for users who will then be more likely to return to the site.
